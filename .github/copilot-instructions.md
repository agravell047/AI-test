## Coding Standards

- Use camelCase for variable, method, and parameter names.
- Use PascalCase for class and interface names.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Use braces `{}` for all code blocks, even single-line blocks.
- Use `final` for constants and variables that should not be reassigned.
- Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables.
- Place each class in its own file.
- Use Javadoc comments for public classes and methods.
- Organize imports: standard Java, third-party, then project-specific.
- Avoid wildcard imports.
- Keep lines under 120 characters.
- Use annotations (e.g., `@Override`, `@RestController`) where appropriate.
- Follow standard Java conventions for spacing and formatting.
- Annotate all Java REST endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI annotations (e.g., `@Operation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@Tag`) to generate API documentation.
- Ensure Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is kept up to date as endpoints are added or changed.
- For every code change, write all related tests in a test file.
